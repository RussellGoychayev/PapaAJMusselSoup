### Description of website/app [summary/pitch]
A social media about food. Like Instagram, users can follow other users, use the explore page (to view random recipes and search for specific recipes based on their names), and like different recipes. Unlike Instagram, we will have a page that displays popular food recipes based on the amount of likes obtained by each recipe from all users.

Our stretch goals are some form of recommending friends based on their recipe tastes (implementation is TBD) and commenting on recipes.
